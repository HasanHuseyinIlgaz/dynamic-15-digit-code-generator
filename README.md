This code is designed to generate a 15-digit unique code. The logic behind it is that each digit is calculated based on the previous digits and weights. The process works as follows:

1. Initial Digits: The first 5 digits are randomly selected.
2. 6th Digit Calculation: The sum of the first 5 digits is taken, and the remainder when divided by 10 gives the 6th digit.
3. Subsequent Digits: Each subsequent digit is derived from weighted calculations based on the previous digits. These weights influence the calculation of each digit and enhance the security of the code.
4. Dynamic Modulus: The modulus value used in calculations changes dynamically based on the previous digit and its weights.

As a result, each digit's value is determined through various calculations, resulting in a unique code.

This code can be used to generate unique identification numbers, product serial numbers, or other identifiers that require high security.
